Healthcare Operations System is a comprehensive web application developed using Spring Boot for the backend and Angular for the frontend. The system provides two distinct dashboards, catering to doctors and administrators, to streamline the management of patients, medicines, and appointments.

User Roles and Dashboards:
- Doctor Dashboard: Allows doctors to view and manage patient lists, add new patients, update existing patient information, and delete patient records. Doctors can also view and manage their appointments.	
- Admin Dashboard: Enables administrators to oversee the entire system, including the ability to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on patients, medicines, and appointments.

Operations:
- Patient Management: View detailed patient lists with search and filter capabilities. Perform CRUD operations on patient records to ensure up-to-date and accurate information.
- Medicine Management: Maintain an up-to-date inventory of medicines. Perform CRUD operations on medicine records, ensuring accurate tracking and availability of medications.
- Appointment Management: Schedule, update, and cancel appointments. Ensure smooth coordination between doctors and patients with an intuitive appointment management system. Technologies Used:

Tech Stack:
- Backend: Spring Boot for building a robust and scalable RESTful API.
- Frontend: Angular for a dynamic and responsive user interface.
- Database: Relational database for storing and managing data efficiently (MySQL).
- Security: Implemented role-based access control to ensure secure and appropriate access to different parts of the application. This 
  project showcases a blend of modern web development technologies and best practices in software design, making it a valuable addition 
  to any portfolio.
